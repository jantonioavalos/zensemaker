**TL;DR:** Here you can read a daily post about productivity, creative strategy, and communication skills. This blog was build from scratch, so I could control the technology constraints, the visual interactions and the content.

> Zensemaker is a blog about productivity, creative strategy and communication skills.

I wanted to write about my everyday problems, ideas, solutions, resources and interesting people. Today's platforms are great but attached to a free template, which is fine to focus in content, but as product designer and software developer, embracing those constraints behind a paywall brings you hacker spirit to make things better and lower costs besides improving the performance and look and feel.
